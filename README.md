Text Summarization Tool
This project is a Text Summarization Tool built using the BART model (facebook-bart-large-cnn) and Streamlit for an interactive web interface. The tool allows users to input text and choose from three summarization styles: Normal, Precise, and Accurate. Depending on the selected style, the tool generates a concise summary of the input text by adjusting the length and other parameters.
